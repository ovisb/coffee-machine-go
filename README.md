This is the *Coffee Machine (GO)* project that is part of Hyperskill platform from Jetbrains Academy.

My learning GO path :)

Very simple CLI project to get the idea of GO, tried to use some of its basic features and added few unit tests to get the hang of it

How to run:
```go
go run cmd/main.go

What do you want to buy? 1 - espresso, 2 - latte, 3 - cappuccino, back - to main menu:
